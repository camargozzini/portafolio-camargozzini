                              <p>I have a strong base as a designer (I studied design at the Universidad Católica de Chile), where I learned that <strong>design is a way of thinking that incorporates different approaches to solve problems within constraints.</strong></p>
                              <p>Once I graduate, I realized that we are surrounded by computers (almost without realizing it) and the great potential they have to reach people all over the world, make our lives simpler and better, democratize information and opportunities. For this reason, I decided to specialize in digital design.</p>

                              <p>I'm good <strong>solving problems, empathizing with users, designing user experiences and interfaces, working with agile methodologies, coding in HTML and SASS, learning new programming languages and working with people.</strong> I'm also good at graphic design, but I don't love it as much I love the digital world.</p>
