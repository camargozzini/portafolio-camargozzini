The objective of the project is to document all cases of corruption in Peru over the past 30 years so that citizens can keep their memories alive and avoid making the same mistakes.</h3>

<h4>Stages of the project for which I was responsible:</h4>
<ul class="linea list-unstyled">
<li>Wireframes design</li>
<li>Mockups design</li>
<li>Site implementation</li>
<li>Brand and graphics design</li>
</ul>

<p>All the documents of the Memoria y Ciudadanía project are hosted in the Uwasi platform of Huridocs, which is very good for storing, organizing and publishing documents, but it needed a more friendly landing for the user, to explain what is the project Memoria y Ciudadanía, the available categories and the stories that can be told from the data.</p>

<p>For this I built a simple landing page, with a search engine as a central element. This was accompanied by a simple paragraph that makes clear everything you can find in the search engine. This was followed by the three major categories of documents available, in case the user prefers to start filtering by his own.</p>

<p>At a second level comes the “Corruption Stories” that are journalistic articles generated from the Memory and Citizenship corruption database. The goal of this section is to inspire the user (mainly investigators and journalists) to use the data to create their own stories or investigations.</p>
