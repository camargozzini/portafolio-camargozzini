    Abre is a project that we started at the beginning of 2017 with Smart Citizen. Within our vision of increasing the involvement of citizens in politics, we realized that local government should have a key role as a minimum governance cell and that it was not being fulfilled in Latin American countries: according to the research, only 6% of Latino citizens trust their local government.

    <p>As we are not experts in the subject, we first did an exhaustive review of background and references of citizen participation in cities around the world, and we contacted the local government of the Peñalolén commune, which was interested in increasing the participation of its neighbours in their public policies.</p>
    <p>Together with them, I guided a process of Human Center Design (IDEO), where we interviewed officials and neighbours, and observed different behaviours and operations in different instances of the municipality. In this process that lasted approximately 3 months, we learned that what the local government in Chile needed to improve the processes of citizen participation was a methodology that mixes the digital and face-to-face, where the neighbours will participate in the raising of proposals, voting, the design, implementation and evaluation of public policies.</p>

      For the web platform we made a fork of the Cónsul platform (the same as that of <a href="https://decide.madrid.es/" target="_blank">Decide Madrid</a> but we had to modify it a lot to adapt it to the Latin American reality: to include follow-up to the instances of face-to-face participation, in addition to facilitating the participation of neighbors with a lower digital literacy.

    <p>The Abre project is implemented in partnership with local governments. For this reason, we needed a site that presented the project to mayors and public administrators.</p>
    <p>The challenge of this website was to present the project Abre in a close and attractive language, which would quickly explain the different components and stages of the project (with the difficulty of having to launch in 2 days for the first hearing with a mayor).</p>
    <p>In the design, I prioritized the simplicity of the contents and images of participating neighbours, which attract public administrators who intend to make their governments more participatory.</p>
