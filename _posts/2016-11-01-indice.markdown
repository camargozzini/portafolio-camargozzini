### {{ page.description }}

#### Stages of the project for which I was responsible:
<ul class="list-unstyled linea">
  <li>Wireframes design</li>
  <li>Mockups design</li>
  <li>Site implementation</li>
  <li>Graphic design for diffusion</li>
</ul>

It is a website consisting mainly of graphics that present the results in a very simple and visual way. Part of the objective was that the graphics were dynamic since it is a study that is carried out every 2 years, so the idea is that for the next version only the new values are entered and it is ready.

<div class="main-slider">
  <div class="item"><img alt="" src="{{ site.baseurl }}img/content/indice/01.png" class="img-responsive"></div>
  <div class="item"><img alt="" src="{{ site.baseurl }}img/content/indice/02.png" class="img-responsive"></div>
  <div class="item"><img alt="" src="{{ site.baseurl }}img/content/indice/03.png" class="img-responsive"></div>
</div>
