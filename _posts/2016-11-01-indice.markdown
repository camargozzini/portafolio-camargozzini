#### Stages of the project for which I was responsible:
<ul class="list-unstyled linea">
  <li>Wireframes design</li>
  <li>Mockups design</li>
  <li>Site implementation</li>
  <li>Graphic design for diffusion</li>
</ul>

It is a website of graphics that present the results of transparency in a very simple and visual way. Part of the objective was that the graphics were dynamic since the study is carried out every 2 years. Therefore, when the next version of the study is out, you only have to put the new values in and it is ready.

  <div class="item"><img alt="" src="{{ site.baseurl }}img/portfolio/indice/02.png" class="img-responsive"></div>
  <div class="item"><img alt="" src="{{ site.baseurl }}img/portfolio/indice/03.png" class="img-responsive"></div>
