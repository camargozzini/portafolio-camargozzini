<h4>Stages of the project for which I was responsible:</h4>
<ul class="linea list-unstyled">
  <li>Wireframes design</li>
  <li>Mockups design</li>
  <li>Site implementation</li>
  <li>Brand and graphics design</li>
</ul>

The Abre project is implemented in partnership with local governments. For this reason, we needed a site that presented the project to mayors and public administrators.

The challenge of this website was to present the project Abre in a close and attractive language, which would quickly explain the different components and stages of the project (with the difficulty of having to launch in 2 days for the first hearing with a mayor).

In the design, I prioritized the simplicity of the contents and images of participating neighbours, which attract public administrators who intend to make their governments more participatory.
