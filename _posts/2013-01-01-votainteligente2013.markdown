This version of the Votainteligente was made for the presidential elections in Chile in 2013. Its objective is the active and informed participation of citizens in the elections.

Votainteligente is a Ciudadano Inteligente project in which I have participated since its creation in 2009, when we launched it for the presidential elections in Chile that year and which contained the profiles and positions of the candidates for the election. This version, which we launched for the 2013 presidential elections, was made with the idea that citizens could easily detect the candidate that is most compatible with their way of thinking. For that, we incorporated a section that we called 'Media Naranja' (Better Half) which, based on a list of questions that the user had to answer on contingent topics, looked in the database for the positions of the candidates and found the most similar. We also incorporate a system so that users can write questions in a public way to candidates so that they can take direct and open contact with their potential leaders.

Challenges:

- Graphic neutrality since it is a project that is reimplemented in several countries, several times a year
- He had to support different types of elections, where he changes the position to which they aspire as the number of candidates (from two to many).
- The most interesting part for users is the Media Naranja, so on the way, we learned that we should put a direct access to that part from the beginning and as the main action (we saw a lot of frustration of users searching for the Media Naranja and they did not find it)
- Find the balance for the question form to find the candidate-citizen match, that had enough content so that the result is as realistic as possible, but at the same time easy to understand and answer for the citizen so that it does not get tired in the path.
