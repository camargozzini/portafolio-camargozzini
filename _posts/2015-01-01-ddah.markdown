<h4>Stages of the project for which I was responsible:</h4>
<ul class="linea list-unstyled">
<li>Wireframes design</li>
<li>Mockups design</li>
<li>Frontend implementation</li>
<li>Brand and graphic design</li>
</ul>

We have exported this idea and methodology to numerous countries in Latin America. That´s why the main challenge was to create a very simple platform, looking forward that people without experience in codes could set it up. The graphics of the site were neutral enough to incorporate an image as header and a logotype that changes according to the installation context.

Under the same idea of simplicity and reproducibility,  I decided to make all charts in D3.js format. In this way, new organizations that want to implement the site only have to put in their data sheets in the platform in order to have their charts automatically unfold.
