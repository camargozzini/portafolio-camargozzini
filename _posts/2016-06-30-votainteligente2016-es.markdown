The first Smart Vote was created in 2009 for the presidential elections and has maintained its central objective: the informed vote. But this version added a new function that proposes a new form of participation for users: they propose projects or ideas that candidates can commit to doing if they are elected.

Designing the users experience was a great challenge since the site has many (and very different) features. The section of the creation of proposals by citizens was especially complex because it had to be simple and short, avoiding long instructions that could frighten the user away.
