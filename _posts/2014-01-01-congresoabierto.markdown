Congreso Abierto (Open Congress) is a Ciudadano Inteligente platform that shows the legislative work in Chile: profile of congressmen, bills with the stages that have passed and their current status, voting and channel of communication with the congressmen.

The design of this site was a very interesting challenge since the operation of the Congress for the citizens is a dark and distant place, they do not know what happens there or feel they have any interference. We tried to make a site as visual as possible without losing seriousness since it was very important that it was reliable as a source for investigators and journalists.

This view corresponds to the project finder, the icon on the left of each project indicates the current status of the project.

In the project view, we see at the beginning the most relevant information, including the possibility that users are the ones who add the tags to the bills, according to the names that are known informally.

This view shows the last votes in the congress. Hovering above you can know exactly who voted that way.
